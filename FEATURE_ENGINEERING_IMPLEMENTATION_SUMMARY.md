# Feature Engineering Engine Implementation Summary

## Task Completed: 5.1 Implement intelligent feature recommendation system

### Requirements Addressed

**Requirement 2.1**: WHEN analyzing raw data THEN the system SHALL suggest relevant feature transformations based on data types and target variables
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: The `FeatureEngineeringEngine.recommend_features()` method analyzes raw data and provides intelligent feature transformation recommendations
- ✅ **VERIFIED**: Automatically detects feature types (numerical, categorical, temporal, text, binary)
- ✅ **VERIFIED**: Suggests transformations based on data characteristics and target variable correlation

**Requirement 2.2**: WHEN preparing data for specific model types THEN the system SHALL recommend optimal encoding strategies for categorical variables
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Model-specific encoding strategies in `_generate_encoding_strategies()` method
- ✅ **VERIFIED**: Different encoding approaches for different model types (one-hot for linear models, label encoding for tree models, target encoding for high cardinality)
- ✅ **VERIFIED**: Cardinality-based encoding selection (binary, one-hot, binary encoding, target encoding)

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Intelligent Feature Analysis
- **Automatic Feature Type Detection**: Detects numerical, categorical, temporal, text, and binary features
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates distribution statistics, outlier rates, missing value rates
- **Correlation Analysis**: Computes correlation with target variables using appropriate methods
- **Quality Metrics**: Assesses feature quality and AI readiness

#### 2. Model-Specific Recommendations
- **Linear Models**: Scaling, normalization, polynomial features, one-hot encoding
- **Tree-Based Models**: Binning, label encoding for high cardinality features
- **Neural Networks**: Normalization, embedding recommendations for high cardinality
- **SVM Models**: Standard scaling (critical for SVM performance)
- **Time Series Models**: Temporal feature extraction and decomposition

#### 3. Categorical Encoding Optimization
- **Low Cardinality (≤10)**: One-hot encoding for linear models, label encoding for tree models
- **Medium Cardinality (11-50)**: Binary encoding to reduce dimensionality
- **High Cardinality (>50)**: Target encoding with smoothing
- **Binary Features**: Optimized binary encoding

#### 4. Advanced Feature Engineering
- **Missing Value Handling**: Creates missing value indicators for informative patterns
- **Feature Interactions**: Generates interaction features for highly correlated variables
- **Temporal Features**: Extracts hour, day, month, year, seasonality components
- **Polynomial Features**: Creates polynomial terms for non-linear relationships

#### 5. Quality Assessment and Recommendations
- **Impact Scoring**: Each recommendation includes expected impact (0-1 scale)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Confidence level for each recommendation
- **Implementation Complexity**: Categorizes recommendations by complexity (low/medium/high)
- **Rationale**: Provides clear explanations for each recommendation
