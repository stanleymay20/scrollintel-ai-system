- **Features**:
  - Environment validation
  - Multiple deployment modes (orchestrated, legacy)
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Deployment summary generation

### 7. Configuration Management (`deployment-config.yaml`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized deployment configuration
- **Features**:
  - Environment-specific settings
  - Phase configuration and timeouts
  - Rollback and monitoring settings
  - Resource requirements
  - Security and compliance settings
