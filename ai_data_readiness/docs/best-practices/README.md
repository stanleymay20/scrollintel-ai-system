## Data Quality Best Practices

### Data Collection
- Establish consistent data collection processes
- Validate data at the source
- Document data sources and collection methods
- Implement data governance policies

### Quality Assessment
- Run comprehensive quality assessments regularly
- Set appropriate quality thresholds for your use case
- Prioritize high-impact quality issues
- Monitor quality trends over time

### Data Improvement
- Address quality issues systematically
- Validate improvements with re-assessment
- Document remediation steps
- Create reproducible improvement pipelines

## Bias Detection and Mitigation

### Detection Strategy
- Identify relevant protected attributes
- Use multiple fairness metrics
- Consider intersectional bias
- Validate bias detection with domain experts

### Mitigation Approaches
- Apply pre-processing techniques when appropriate
- Consider in-processing fairness constraints
- Use post-processing adjustments carefully
- Monitor fairness metrics continuously

## Feature Engineering Guidelines

### Feature Selection
- Use domain knowledge to guide selection
- Apply statistical tests for relevance
- Consider feature interactions
- Remove redundant features

### Transformation Best Practices
- Document all transformations
- Validate transformations on test data
- Consider feature scaling requirements
- Handle missing values appropriately

## Compliance and Privacy

### Regulatory Compliance
- Identify applicable regulations early
- Implement privacy-by-design principles
- Document compliance measures
- Regular compliance audits

### Data Protection
- Use appropriate anonymization techniques
- Implement access controls
- Monitor data usage
- Maintain audit trails

## Performance Optimization

### System Performance
- Monitor resource usage
- Optimize database queries
