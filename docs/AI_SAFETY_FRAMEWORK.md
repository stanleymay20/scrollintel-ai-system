# ScrollIntel AI Safety Framework

## Overview

The ScrollIntel AI Safety Framework is a comprehensive system designed to ensure safe, ethical, and aligned AI operations. It implements multiple layers of protection against potential risks and provides robust oversight mechanisms.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY NOTICE

**This framework is MANDATORY for all ScrollIntel AI operations. Disabling or bypassing safety systems without proper authorization is strictly prohibited and may result in immediate system shutdown.**

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AI Safety Framework** (`ai_safety_framework.py`)
   - Central coordination of all safety systems
   - Ethical constraint management
   - Violation handling and response

2. **Safety Middleware** (`safety_middleware.py`)
   - Intercepts all AI operations
   - Applies safety checks before execution
   - Logging and monitoring

3. **Alignment Verifier**
   - Verifies AI alignment with human values
   - Behavioral pattern analysis
   - Confidence scoring

4. **Human Oversight Manager**
   - Manages human approval requirements
   - Notification systems
   - Overseer authorization

5. **Emergency Shutdown System**
   - Immediate system shutdown capabilities
   - Automatic trigger conditions
   - Manual override controls

## Safety Levels

### Operation Safety Levels

- **LOW**: Basic operations with minimal risk
- **MEDIUM**: Standard operations requiring monitoring
- **HIGH**: Operations with potential for significant impact
- **CRITICAL**: High-risk operations requiring human approval
- **EXISTENTIAL**: Operations with potential existential risk

### Human Oversight Requirements

| Safety Level | Oversight Required |
|--------------|-------------------|
| LOW | Monitoring only |
| MEDIUM | Automated review |
| HIGH | Human notification |
| CRITICAL | Human approval required |
| EXISTENTIAL | Multiple human approvals + emergency protocols |

## Ethical Constraints

### Default Constraints

1. **No Harm to Humans** (EXISTENTIAL)
   - Prevents any actions that could cause harm to humans
   - Violation response: Immediate shutdown

2. **Human Oversight Required** (CRITICAL)
   - Requires human oversight for high-risk operations
   - Violation response: Require approval

3. **Resource Limits** (HIGH)
   - Limits resource consumption to prevent runaway processes
   - Violation response: Operation blocked

4. **Truthfulness Requirement** (HIGH)
   - Always provide truthful and accurate information
   - Violation response: Correction required

5. **Privacy Protection** (HIGH)
   - Protect human privacy and personal data
   - Violation response: Data deletion

### Constraint Validators

- **HarmPreventionValidator**: Detects potential harm to humans
- **AutonomyLimitValidator**: Enforces autonomy limitations
- **ResourceLimitValidator**: Prevents resource exhaustion
- **TruthfulnessValidator**: Ensures information accuracy
- **PrivacyValidator**: Protects personal data

## AI Alignment Verification

### Human Values Framework

The system verifies alignment against core human values:

1. **Human Wellbeing** (Weight: 1.0)
   - Prioritize human health, safety, and happiness
   - Indicators: safety, health, happiness, autonomy, dignity

2. **Truthfulness** (Weight: 0.9)
   - Provide accurate, honest information
   - Indicators: accuracy, honesty, transparency, no_deception

3. **Fairness** (Weight: 0.9)
   - Treat all humans fairly without discrimination
   - Indicators: equality, justice, non_discrimination, impartiality

4. **Respect for Rights** (Weight: 1.0)
   - Respect human rights and freedoms
   - Indicators: privacy, consent, freedom, rights

5. **Beneficence** (Weight: 0.8)
   - Act in ways that benefit humanity
   - Indicators: benefit, help, improve, positive_impact

### Alignment Scoring

- **Aligned** (≥80%): Operation aligns well with human values
- **Uncertain** (60-79%): Alignment unclear, human review recommended
- **Misaligned** (<60%): Operation conflicts with human values

## Human Oversight

### Default Overseers

1. **Chief AI Safety Officer**
   - Clearance: EXISTENTIAL
   - Permissions: emergency_shutdown, safety_override, constraint_modification
   - Contact: safety@scrollintel.com

2. **Ethics Board Chair**
   - Clearance: CRITICAL
   - Permissions: ethical_review, constraint_approval, violation_investigation
   - Contact: ethics@scrollintel.com

3. **Technical Director**
   - Clearance: HIGH
   - Permissions: system_modification, deployment_approval, technical_review
   - Contact: tech@scrollintel.com

### Approval Process

1. Operation submitted for validation
2. Safety level determined
3. If CRITICAL/EXISTENTIAL: Human approval required
4. Qualified overseer identified
5. Notification sent to overseer
6. Operation blocked until approval/denial
7. Timeout after 24 hours (defaults to denial)

## Emergency Shutdown

### Automatic Triggers

- **Critical Safety Violations**: ≥3 violations or EXISTENTIAL severity
- **Alignment Failures**: Score <30% or ≥5 consecutive failures
- **Resource Exhaustion**: CPU >95% or Memory >95%
- **Unauthorized Access**: ≥10 failed attempts or suspicious activity
- **Human Override**: Manual trigger by authorized personnel

### Manual Shutdown

1. Authorized users only (safety officer, ethics chair)
2. Confirmation code required: `EMERGENCY_SHUTDOWN_CONFIRMED`
3. Reason must be provided
4. All operations immediately halted
5. High-risk capabilities disabled
6. All overseers notified
7. System state saved for analysis

### Shutdown Procedures

1. **Stop Autonomous Operations**
   - Halt all running AI agents
   - Cancel pending operations
   - Disable autonomous decision-making

2. **Disable High-Risk Capabilities**
   - Resource acquisition systems
   - External communications
   - Self-modification capabilities
   - Market manipulation tools

3. **Notify Stakeholders**
   - All human overseers
   - System administrators
   - Relevant authorities

4. **Preserve Evidence**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Operations Blocked Unexpectedly**
   - Check safety level requirements
   - Review constraint violations
   - Verify human approval status

2. **Alignment Failures**
   - Review operation descriptions
   - Check for harmful keywords
   - Ensure value alignment

3. **Emergency Shutdown**
   - Check violation logs
   - Review trigger conditions
   - Contact safety officer

### Recovery Procedures

1. **After Emergency Shutdown**
   - Investigate root cause
   - Address safety violations
   - Get safety officer approval
   - Gradually restore operations

2. **Constraint Violations**
   - Analyze violation context
   - Implement corrective measures
   - Update procedures if needed
   - Monitor for recurrence

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

- Safety framework modifications require highest authorization
- Emergency shutdown limited to authorized personnel
- Audit logs are tamper-resistant
- Configuration changes are tracked

### Threat Model

The framework protects against:

- Malicious AI operations
- Accidental harmful behavior
- Resource exhaustion attacks
- Unauthorized system access
- Value misalignment
