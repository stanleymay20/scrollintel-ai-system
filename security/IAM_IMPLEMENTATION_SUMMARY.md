- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of all access requests and approvals

### 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Hierarchical Roles**: Support for role inheritance and nested permissions
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Automatic enforcement of minimal required permissions
- **Conditional Access**: Time-based, location-based, and resource-based conditions
- **Dynamic Permission Evaluation**: Real-time permission checking with context awareness
- **System Roles**: Pre-configured viewer, editor, and admin roles

### 4. User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)
- **Anomaly Detection**: ML-based detection of unusual access patterns
- **Behavioral Profiling**: Automatic learning of user behavior patterns
- **Risk Scoring**: Dynamic risk assessment based on multiple factors
- **Alert Generation**: Real-time security alerts with confidence scoring
- **Pattern Analysis**: Detection of time-based, location-based, and volume anomalies
- **Permission Escalation Detection**: Identification of potential privilege escalation attempts

### 5. Advanced Session Management
- **Concurrent Session Control**: Configurable limits with device-aware management
- **Timeout Controls**: Sliding window and absolute timeout enforcement
- **Session Security**: IP validation, device fingerprinting, and fixation protection
- **Multi-Device Support**: Cross-device session management with continuity
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Background cleanup of expired sessions and challenges
