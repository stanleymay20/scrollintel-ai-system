# Image Generation Pipeline Implementation Summary

## Task Completed: 2.4 Create unified image generation interface

### Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive unified image generation interface that orchestrates multiple models (Stable Diffusion XL, DALL-E 3, Midjourney) with intelligent model selection, result aggregation, and quality comparison functionality.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. ImageGenerationPipeline Class
- **Location**: `scrollintel/engines/visual_generation/pipeline.py`
- **Purpose**: Main orchestration class that provides unified interface for image generation
- **Features**:
  - Intelligent model selection based on request parameters
  - Parallel generation across multiple models
  - Result aggregation and quality comparison
  - Automatic fallback handling
  - Cost and time estimation
  - Comprehensive error handling

### 2. ModelSelector Class
- **Purpose**: Intelligent model selection based on various strategies
- **Selection Strategies**:
  - `BEST_QUALITY`: Selects highest quality model
  - `FASTEST`: Selects fastest generation model
  - `MOST_COST_EFFECTIVE`: Selects most cost-effective model
  - `BALANCED`: Balanced selection across all factors
  - `USER_PREFERENCE`: Honors user's model preference
  - `ALL_MODELS`: Selects all models for comparison

### 3. ResultAggregator Class
- **Purpose**: Aggregates and compares results from multiple models
- **Features**:
  - Quality ranking based on metrics
  - Cost and time comparison
  - Best result selection
  - Recommendation generation

### 4. Model Capabilities System
- **ModelCapability**: Defines capabilities of each model
- **Metrics**: Quality score, speed score, cost score, style compatibility
- **Resolution Support**: Tracks supported resolutions per model
- **Availability Tracking**: Monitors model availability and rate limits

## Implementation Details

### Model Integration
- **Stable Diffusion XL**: High-quality, cost-effective, good speed
- **DALL-E 3**: Highest quality, slower, more expensive
- **Midjourney**: Artistic excellence, queue-dependent speed

### Selection Logic
```python
def calculate_balanced_score(model_name: str) -> float:
    capability = self.model_capabilities[model_name]
    style_score = capability.style_compatibility.get(request.style, 0.5)
    
    # Weighted combination of factors
    score = (
        capability.quality_score * 0.4 +
        capability.speed_score * 0.2 +
        capability.cost_score * 0.2 +
        style_score * 0.15 +
        capability.availability_score * 0.05
    )
    return score
```

### Multi-Model Orchestration
- Parallel execution of multiple models
- Result comparison and ranking
