## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### Backend Components

#### 1. Database Models (`scrollintel/models/user_management_models.py`)
```python
- Organization: Multi-tenant organization management
- Workspace: Project workspace with settings and access control
- WorkspaceMember: Member association with roles and permissions
- Project: Project organization within workspaces
```

#### 2. Service Layer (`scrollintel/core/user_management.py`)
```python
- create_workspace(): Create new workspaces with validation
- add_workspace_member(): Add members with role assignment
- remove_workspace_member(): Remove members with audit logging
- get_user_workspaces(): Query user-accessible workspaces
- get_workspace_members(): List workspace members
- update_workspace(): Update workspace settings
- _check_workspace_permission(): Permission validation
```

#### 3. API Routes (`scrollintel/api/routes/user_management_routes.py`)
```python
- POST /organizations/{id}/workspaces: Create workspace
- GET /workspaces: List user workspaces
- GET /workspaces/{id}: Get workspace details
- PUT /workspaces/{id}: Update workspace settings
- GET /workspaces/{id}/members: List workspace members
- POST /workspaces/{id}/members: Add workspace member
- DELETE /workspaces/{id}/members/{user_id}: Remove member
```

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Workspace Manager (`frontend/src/components/user-management/workspace-manager.tsx`)
```typescript
- Workspace creation form with validation
- Workspace listing with search and filtering
- Member management modal with role assignment
- Settings modal for workspace configuration
- Real-time member status and permissions display
```

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Owner**: Full workspace control, cannot be removed
- **Admin**: Member management, workspace settings
- **Member**: Project creation, data access
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to workspace content

### Permission System
```python
# Granular permissions for fine-grained control
permissions = [
    "view_workspace",      # View workspace details
    "manage_workspace",    # Update workspace settings
    "view_members",        # View member list
    "manage_members",      # Add/remove members
    "view_data",          # Access workspace data
    "create_projects",    # Create new projects
    "manage_projects"     # Manage existing projects
]
```

### Security Features
- Organization-level workspace limits enforcement
- Permission validation on all API endpoints
- Audit logging for compliance tracking
- Session-based authentication integration
- Input validation and sanitization

## 📊 Database Schema

### Key Relationships
```sql
Organization (1) → (N) Workspace
Workspace (1) → (N) WorkspaceMember
Workspace (1) → (N) Project
User (1) → (N) WorkspaceMember
```

### Indexes for Performance
```sql
- idx_workspace_organization: Fast organization queries
- idx_workspace_owner: Owner-based filtering
- idx_workspace_visibility: Visibility-based access
- idx_workspace_member_workspace: Member lookups
- idx_workspace_member_user: User workspace queries
```
