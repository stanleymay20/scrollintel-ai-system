## API and Usage

### Convenience Functions
```python
# Protect user data
await protect_data(user_id, data_type, data, device_id)

# Recover user data
recovered = await recover_data(user_id, data_type)

# Create recovery point
recovery_id = await create_recovery_point(user_id, description)
```

### Decorator Support
```python
@with_data_protection('analysis_results')
async def perform_analysis(user_id, data):
    # Function automatically protects its results
    return analysis_results
```

### System Integration
```python
# Start the protection system
await data_protection_system.start()

# Get protection status
status = await data_protection_system.get_protection_status(user_id)

# Comprehensive protection
success = await data_protection_system.protect_user_data(
    user_id, data_type, data, device_id
)
```
