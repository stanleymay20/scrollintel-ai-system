## Sample API Usage

### Record a Performance Metric
```bash
curl -X POST "/api/v1/bulletproof-monitoring/metrics/record" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "user123",
    "metric_type": "performance", 
    "value": 250.0,
    "context": {"endpoint": "/api/test"},
    "component": "api_gateway"
  }'
```

### Get Real-time Dashboard
```bash
curl -X GET "/api/v1/bulletproof-monitoring/dashboard/realtime"
```

### Record User Satisfaction
```bash
curl -X POST "/api/v1/bulletproof-monitoring/feedback/satisfaction" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "user123",
    "satisfaction_score": 4.5,
    "feedback_text": "Great experience!",
    "context": {"feature": "dashboard"}
  }'
```
