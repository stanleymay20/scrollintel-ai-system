- Automated IP blocking and session revocation
- Manual task creation for complex remediation
- SLA-based escalation rules

#### 5. Data Privacy Controls (`security/compliance/data_privacy_controls.py`)
- **GDPR/CCPA compliance**: Automated data subject request handling
- **30-day SLA**: Automated processing within regulatory timeframes
- **Consent management**: Record and track data processing consent
- **Data inventory**: Comprehensive mapping of personal data storage
- **Automated workflows**: Identity verification and data collection

**Key Features:**
- Access, rectification, erasure, portability request types
- Automated identity verification via email
- Data collection from multiple sources
- Consent withdrawal tracking
- Privacy dashboard with metrics

#### 6. API Routes (`security/api/routes/compliance_audit_routes.py`)
- **RESTful endpoints**: Complete API for all compliance functions
- **Authentication**: Bearer token security for all endpoints
- **Background processing**: Async task handling for long-running operations
- **Health monitoring**: Service status and metrics endpoints
- **Integration ready**: FastAPI-based for easy integration

### Demo Results

The comprehensive demo (`demo_compliance_audit_framework.py`) successfully demonstrated:

#### Immutable Audit Logging

- ✅ Created blockchain blocks with proof-of-work mining
- ✅ Verified blockchain integrity (100% valid)
- ✅ Retrieved audit trail with filtering capabilities
- ✅ Blockchain statistics: 3 blocks, 10 events, 0 pending

#### Compliance Reporting
- ✅ Updated control statuses across multiple frameworks
- ✅ Generated compliance reports for SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA
- ✅ SOC 2 Type II: 66.7% compliant (2/3 controls)
- ✅ GDPR: 33.3% compliant with recommendations
- ✅ HIPAA: 33.3% compliant
- ✅ Dashboard showing overall 33.3% compliance across 12 controls

#### Evidence Generation
- ✅ Generated evidence package for SOC 2 Type II
- ✅ Collected 2 evidence items (security policies, vulnerability scans)
- ✅ Created ZIP package with manifest and integrity hash
- ✅ Covered controls SOC2-CC1.1 and SOC2-CC3.1
- ✅ Generation time: 0.015 seconds (demonstrating efficiency)

#### Violation Detection
- ✅ Started violation monitoring system
- ✅ Initialized detection rules for failed logins and privileged access
- ✅ Dashboard showing violation metrics structure
- ✅ Remediation workflow framework in place

#### Data Privacy Controls
- ✅ Recorded consent for 2 data subjects
- ✅ Submitted 3 data subject requests (access, portability, erasure)
- ✅ Automated identity verification via email tokens
