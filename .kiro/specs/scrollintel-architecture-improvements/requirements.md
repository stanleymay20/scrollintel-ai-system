# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the architectural improvements needed to transform ScrollIntel into a production-ready, scalable AI system based on industry best practices and community recommendations. The improvements focus on modular agent design, structured workflows, intelligent orchestration, and responsible AI patterns to create a robust, maintainable, and efficient AI platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Precisely Scoped Agent Architecture

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want each agent to have narrow, well-defined responsibilities, so that the system is more maintainable, debuggable, and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent is designed THEN it SHALL handle only one specific type of task or capability
2. WHEN multiple processing steps are needed THEN the system SHALL use multi-step pipelines rather than monolithic prompt chains
3. WHEN an agent receives a request THEN it SHALL validate that the request matches its specific scope of responsibility
4. IF a request requires multiple capabilities THEN the system SHALL route it through appropriate agent pipelines
5. WHEN agents are deployed THEN each agent SHALL have clear documentation of its single responsibility

### Requirement 2: Structured Output Enforcement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all agent communications to use structured schemas, so that I can reliably chain agents together and debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent processes a request THEN it SHALL return output in a predefined JSON schema format
2. WHEN agents communicate THEN they SHALL use strongly-typed interfaces with validation
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN structured outputs SHALL provide clear traceability
4. IF schema validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating the validation failure
5. WHEN new agents are added THEN they SHALL conform to the established schema standards

### Requirement 3: Supervisor-Based Orchestration

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want a master orchestrator agent that coordinates sub-agents, so that multi-agent workflows are reliable and controllable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complex workflows are executed THEN a ScrollConductor agent SHALL orchestrate the process
2. WHEN sub-agents are invoked THEN the supervisor SHALL monitor their execution and handle failures
3. WHEN workflow decisions are needed THEN the supervisor SHALL route requests to appropriate specialized agents
4. IF a sub-agent fails THEN the supervisor SHALL implement retry logic or alternative routing
5. WHEN workflows complete THEN the supervisor SHALL aggregate results and provide unified responses

### Requirement 4: Modular Component Architecture

**User Story:** As a development team, I want loosely coupled, replaceable system modules, so that we can evolve and scale individual components independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system components are designed THEN they SHALL be loosely coupled with well-defined interfaces
2. WHEN a component needs replacement THEN it SHALL be swappable without affecting other components
3. WHEN scaling is needed THEN individual components SHALL be scalable independently
4. IF component interfaces change THEN backward compatibility SHALL be maintained or migration paths provided
5. WHEN new features are added THEN they SHALL integrate through existing component interfaces

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Feedback and Audit System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want continuous evaluation and feedback mechanisms, so that I can monitor system performance and ensure quality outputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with the system THEN they SHALL be able to provide feedback on agent responses
2. WHEN system outputs are generated THEN they SHALL be evaluated for accuracy, relevance, and alignment
3. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN automated alerts SHALL be triggered
4. IF quality metrics fall below thresholds THEN the system SHALL initiate corrective actions
5. WHEN audits are performed THEN comprehensive logs and metrics SHALL be available for analysis

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization Framework

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want optimized system performance through caching, model efficiency, and resource management, so that the system operates cost-effectively at scale.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN common queries are processed THEN results SHALL be cached to reduce latency and costs
2. WHEN models are deployed THEN quantization and distillation SHALL be used where appropriate
3. WHEN long reasoning chains are needed THEN they SHALL be broken into shorter, optimized prompts
4. IF resource usage exceeds thresholds THEN automatic scaling and optimization SHALL be triggered
5. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN they SHALL inform continuous optimization decisions

### Requirement 7: Open Collaboration Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a development community member, I want to contribute to and benefit from ScrollIntel's open-source components, so that the platform can evolve through collaborative innovation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN core components are stable THEN they SHALL be available as open-source modules
2. WHEN external contributions are made THEN they SHALL go through proper review and integration processes
3. WHEN documentation is created THEN it SHALL support both internal development and external contributions
4. IF community feedback is provided THEN it SHALL be incorporated into development planning
5. WHEN partnerships are formed THEN they SHALL follow established collaboration protocols

### Requirement 8: Responsible AI Governance

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive AI governance including bias mitigation, traceability, and ethical review, so that the system operates responsibly and meets regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI decisions are made THEN they SHALL be traceable through comprehensive audit logs
2. WHEN bias is detected THEN mitigation strategies SHALL be automatically applied
3. WHEN ethical concerns arise THEN review processes SHALL be triggered with appropriate stakeholder involvement
4. IF regulatory requirements change THEN the system SHALL adapt to maintain compliance
5. WHEN AI outputs are generated THEN they SHALL include confidence scores and uncertainty indicators

### Requirement 9: Intelligent Load Balancing and Routing

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want intelligent request routing that considers agent capabilities, performance, and current load, so that system resources are optimally utilized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests are received THEN they SHALL be routed to the most appropriate available agent
2. WHEN multiple agents can handle a request THEN routing SHALL consider performance metrics and current load
3. WHEN agents become unavailable THEN requests SHALL be automatically rerouted to alternatives
4. IF system load increases THEN additional agent instances SHALL be automatically provisioned
5. WHEN routing decisions are made THEN they SHALL be logged for performance analysis

### Requirement 10: Advanced Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive system monitoring with real-time metrics, alerting, and diagnostic capabilities, so that I can maintain system health and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system components operate THEN they SHALL emit detailed metrics and health indicators
2. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN alerts SHALL be sent to appropriate personnel with diagnostic information
3. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN comprehensive logs and traces SHALL be available
4. IF performance degrades THEN root cause analysis tools SHALL help identify issues quickly
5. WHEN capacity planning is needed THEN historical metrics SHALL inform scaling decisions
