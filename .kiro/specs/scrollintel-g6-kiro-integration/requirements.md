# Requirements Document - ScrollIntel-G6: Kiro-Ready Integration & Training Platform

## Introduction

The ScrollIntel-G6 Kiro-Ready Integration & Training Platform delivers a "GPT-6-class experience" through supercomposition, verifier-first pipelines, distillation, and targeted capability expansion to neutralize GPT-5's advantages. The system implements a self-reinforcing Data Products Flywheel that makes data AI-ready by design, ensuring ScrollIntel outperforms GPT-5 on ScrollBench across build-to-prod, policy drafts, roadmaps, BI, and PRs that pass CI/CD.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data products are created THEN the system SHALL automatically apply AI-driven cleaning, labeling, and metadata enrichment
2. WHEN AI models consume data THEN the system SHALL use structured, governed, versioned datasets to improve accuracy and explainability
3. WHEN data quality improves THEN the system SHALL demonstrate measurable AI performance gains
4. IF flywheel efficiency degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize the feedback loop

### Requirement 3: Data Product Registry & Governance

**User Story:** As a data governance manager, I want a centralized data product registry with comprehensive governance, so that all data assets are discoverable, compliant, and reusable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data products are registered THEN the system SHALL catalog schema, provenance, compliance info, and metadata
2. WHEN users search for data THEN the system SHALL provide discoverable, indexed, and API-accessible data products
3. WHEN governance policies are applied THEN the system SHALL enforce RBAC, lineage tracking, and compliance tags
4. IF non-compliant data is detected THEN the system SHALL quarantine products until remediation is complete

### Requirement 4: Automated Data Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want automated data QA agents, so that I can trust data quality without manual validation while detecting schema drift and anomalies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data flows through the system THEN automated agents SHALL detect schema drift, anomalies, and bias
2. WHEN quality issues are identified THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports with remediation recommendations
3. WHEN bias is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically flag violations and suggest fairness improvements
4. IF critical quality thresholds are breached THEN the system SHALL prevent downstream AI consumption

### Requirement 5: Data Lineage & Provenance Tracking

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive data lineage graphs, so that I can track data origins, transformations, and downstream usage for audit and regulatory purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data transformations occur THEN the system SHALL maintain complete lineage from source to consumption
2. WHEN audits are conducted THEN the system SHALL provide detailed provenance verification and transformation history
3. WHEN data products are versioned THEN the system SHALL track hash-based version control with freshness checks
4. IF lineage gaps are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and prevent data product certification

### Requirement 6: Multi-Agent MoE Architecture

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a multi-agent mixture of experts architecture, so that specialized agents can handle domain-specific tasks while maintaining overall system coherence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complex queries are received THEN the system SHALL route to appropriate specialized agents based on domain expertise
2. WHEN agents collaborate THEN the system SHALL implement verifier-first pipelines to ensure output quality
3. WHEN performance optimization is needed THEN the system SHALL dynamically adjust agent allocation and routing
4. IF agent conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL implement consensus mechanisms and escalation procedures

### Requirement 7: Continuous Self-Improvement Loop

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want continuous self-improvement capabilities, so that the system automatically enhances performance based on usage patterns and feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system interactions occur THEN the system SHALL collect performance metrics and user feedback
2. WHEN improvement opportunities are identified THEN the system SHALL automatically implement optimizations
3. WHEN new capabilities are needed THEN the system SHALL expand functionality through targeted training and adaptation
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL implement rollback mechanisms and root cause analysis

### Requirement 8: Data Product Verifier Suite

**User Story:** As a quality assurance manager, I want comprehensive data product verification, so that only compliant, high-quality data products are available for AI consumption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data products are submitted THEN the system SHALL perform schema validation, compliance scans, and provenance verification
2. WHEN bias and fairness checks are conducted THEN the system SHALL ensure compliance with ethical AI standards
3. WHEN freshness SLA checks are performed THEN the system SHALL validate data currency and update schedules
4. IF verification fails THEN the system SHALL quarantine products and provide detailed remediation guidance

### Requirement 9: ScrollBench Performance Targets

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want measurable performance targets against GPT-5, so that I can validate ScrollIntel's competitive advantage across key use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN build-to-prod scenarios are tested THEN the system SHALL achieve ≥95% success rate compared to GPT-5's performance
2. WHEN policy drafts are generated THEN the system SHALL demonstrate superior quality and compliance compared to GPT-5
3. WHEN BI and roadmap tasks are executed THEN the system SHALL outperform GPT-5 in accuracy and business relevance
4. IF performance falls below targets THEN the system SHALL trigger automatic improvement cycles

### Requirement 10: Data Products KPI Monitoring

**User Story:** As a data operations manager, I want comprehensive KPI monitoring for the data products flywheel, so that I can ensure optimal performance and continuous improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI queries are processed THEN ≥95% SHALL be served from registered, verified data products
2. WHEN data freshness is evaluated THEN ≥90% of data products SHALL be updated/refreshed on schedule
3. WHEN compliance is assessed THEN ≥98% compliance with governance schema SHALL be maintained
