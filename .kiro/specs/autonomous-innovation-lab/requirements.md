# Requirements Document - Autonomous Innovation Lab System

## Introduction

The Autonomous Innovation Lab System enables ScrollIntel to conduct breakthrough research and development autonomously, creating novel technologies, products, and solutions without human intervention. This system provides automated experimentation, invention generation, and innovation acceleration that surpasses human R&D capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an innovation director, I want autonomous invention generation, so that I can create breakthrough technologies faster than any human R&D team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN innovation challenges are identified THEN the system SHALL generate novel solution concepts automatically
2. WHEN technical problems arise THEN the system SHALL invent new approaches and methodologies
3. WHEN breakthrough opportunities exist THEN the system SHALL design and test innovative solutions
4. IF invention potential is detected THEN the system SHALL file patents and protect intellectual property

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a research accelerator, I want automated experimentation at massive scale, so that I can test thousands of hypotheses simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hypotheses are generated THEN the system SHALL design and execute experiments automatically
2. WHEN experimental results arrive THEN the system SHALL analyze and iterate on findings instantly
3. WHEN promising directions emerge THEN the system SHALL scale up experimentation automatically
4. IF experimental failures occur THEN the system SHALL learn and adapt experimental approaches

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a technology synthesizer, I want cross-domain innovation fusion, so that I can combine insights from multiple fields to create breakthrough solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing different domains THEN the system SHALL identify fusion opportunities automatically
2. WHEN technologies converge THEN the system SHALL create novel combinations and applications
3. WHEN interdisciplinary insights emerge THEN the system SHALL synthesize them into innovations
4. IF fusion potential exists THEN the system SHALL prototype and validate hybrid solutions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a product visionary, I want autonomous product development, so that I can create market-ready innovations without human development teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN market needs are identified THEN the system SHALL design complete product solutions
2. WHEN prototypes are needed THEN the system SHALL create and test functional prototypes
3. WHEN products require refinement THEN the system SHALL iterate designs based on testing
4. IF market readiness is achieved THEN the system SHALL prepare products for launch automatically
