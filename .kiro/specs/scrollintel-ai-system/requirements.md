# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ScrollIntelâ„¢ is a sovereign AI intelligence system designed to replace the need for a CTO or full data/AI team by embedding autonomous, prophetic AI intelligence directly into enterprise environments. The system provides a comprehensive suite of AI agents and modules that can handle technical vision, data science, machine learning engineering, AI engineering, business intelligence, and data analysis tasks autonomously and securely.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a founder/CEO, I want a complete AI system that eliminates the need for hiring a CTO and data team, so that I can make AI/BI decisions without technical staff.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses ScrollIntel THEN the system SHALL provide autonomous agents for CTO, Data Scientist, ML Engineer, AI Engineer, Data Analyst, and BI Developer roles
2. WHEN a user uploads data files (.csv, .xlsx, .sql, .json) THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and run appropriate analyses
3. WHEN a user requests technical architecture decisions THEN the ScrollCTOAgent SHALL provide stack planning and scaling strategy recommendations
4. IF a user needs data insights THEN the system SHALL generate reports, dashboards, and KPIs without manual intervention

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to interact with all my company data through natural language, so that I can get insights without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks questions in natural language THEN the ScrollQA module SHALL provide answers from any dataset
2. WHEN a user requests visualizations THEN the ScrollViz module SHALL generate charts and graphs from prompts or datasets
3. WHEN a user needs forecasting THEN the ScrollForecast module SHALL provide time series predictions using Prophet, ARIMA, or LSTM
4. IF a user uploads new data THEN the system SHALL automatically integrate it into the chat interface

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ScrollIntel to automatically build and deploy ML models, so that I can focus on business logic rather than ML infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is provided THEN the AutoModel module SHALL train and test multiple ML models automatically
2. WHEN model training completes THEN the system SHALL provide performance summaries and export options
3. WHEN models are ready THEN the system SHALL expose them via FastAPI endpoints
4. IF model retraining is needed THEN the system SHALL handle it autonomously with minimal user intervention

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an organization (NGO, government, church), I want live dashboards that monitor key metrics, so that I can track progress on important initiatives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dashboard requirements are specified THEN the ScrollBI agent SHALL build interactive dashboards instantly
2. WHEN data changes THEN dashboards SHALL update in real-time
3. WHEN alerts are configured THEN the system SHALL notify users of important changes
4. IF custom visualizations are needed THEN the system SHALL support Recharts, Plotly, and Vega libraries

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want all AI operations to be auditable and role-based, so that I can maintain control over sensitive data and operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any AI operation occurs THEN the system SHALL log it with EXOUSIA trace for audit purposes
2. WHEN users access the system THEN role-based permissions SHALL be enforced through EXOUSIA
3. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN JWT authentication and session tracing SHALL be required
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL block and log the attempt

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want ScrollIntel to be deployable across multiple platforms, so that I can choose the best hosting option for my organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the frontend THEN the system SHALL support Vercel deployment with Next.js + Tailwind + ShadCN
2. WHEN deploying the backend THEN the system SHALL support Render + Docker deployment with FastAPI
3. WHEN setting up databases THEN the system SHALL integrate with PostgreSQL, Pinecone, Supabase Vector, and Redis
4. IF scaling is needed THEN the architecture SHALL support horizontal scaling of AI agents

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a power user, I want to extend ScrollIntel with custom AI modules, so that I can adapt the system to specific business needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new AI modules are needed THEN the ScrollModelFactory SHALL allow creation via UI
2. WHEN custom agents are developed THEN the agent registry SHALL manage them automatically
3. WHEN insights need storage THEN the ScrollIntel Vault SHALL store results securely
4. IF pattern detection is required THEN the ScrollInsightRadar SHALL identify trends automatically

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an AI engineer, I want ScrollIntel to integrate with modern AI services, so that I can leverage the best available models and tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI processing is needed THEN the system SHALL support GPT-4, Claude, and Whisper integration
2. WHEN vector operations are required THEN the system SHALL use embeddings and vector stores effectively
3. WHEN RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is needed THEN the AI Engineer module SHALL implement it automatically
4. IF LangChain workflows are required THEN the system SHALL support them natively
