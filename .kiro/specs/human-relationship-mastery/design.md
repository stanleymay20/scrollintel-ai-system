        """Establish professional credibility through consistent delivery"""
        
    def manage_transparency(self, situation: Situation) -> TransparencyLevel:
        """Determine appropriate level of openness"""
        
    def demonstrate_reliability(self, commitment: Commitment) -> ReliabilityAction:
