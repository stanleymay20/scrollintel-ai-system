# Requirements Document - ScrollIntel Production Readiness Enhancement

## Introduction

ScrollIntel Production Readiness Enhancement focuses on transforming the comprehensive ScrollIntel platform into a truly enterprise-ready AI-CTO replacement system. While ScrollIntel has an excellent foundation with 20+ AI agents and extensive capabilities, this enhancement addresses critical gaps that prevent enterprise adoption: real-time collaboration, advanced enterprise integration, production-grade model lifecycle management, and unified analytics dashboards.

This enhancement ensures ScrollIntel can compete directly with enterprise platforms like DataRobot, H2O.ai, and Databricks by providing the collaborative, secure, and scalable features that Fortune 500 companies require for AI-CTO replacement.

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want advanced model interpretability, so that I can explain AI decisions to stakeholders and regulators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model explanations are requested THEN the system SHALL provide SHAP, LIME, and attention visualizations
2. WHEN global interpretability is needed THEN the system SHALL generate feature importance and model behavior summaries
3. WHEN bias detection is required THEN the system SHALL audit models for fairness across protected attributes
4. IF explanations are exported THEN the system SHALL generate reports suitable for regulatory submission

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a business user, I want intelligent cost optimization, so that AI operations run efficiently within budget constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resources are allocated THEN the system SHALL optimize compute usage based on workload patterns
