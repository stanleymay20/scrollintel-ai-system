# Design Document - ScrollIntel Production Readiness Enhancement

## Overview

The ScrollIntel Production Readiness Enhancement transforms the existing comprehensive AI platform into an enterprise-ready system by adding critical collaborative, integration, and governance capabilities. This design leverages ScrollIntel's existing agent architecture, EXOUSIA security framework, and FastAPI backend while adding new components for real-time collaboration, enterprise integration, and advanced analytics.

The enhancement follows a microservices architecture pattern, extending the existing system with new services that integrate seamlessly with current agents and engines while maintaining backward compatibility.
