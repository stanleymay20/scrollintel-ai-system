# Requirements Document - Real-time Collaboration System

## Introduction

The Real-time Collaboration System enables multiple users to work together seamlessly within ScrollIntel workspaces, providing shared access to data, models, insights, and collaborative decision-making capabilities. This system transforms ScrollIntel from a single-user AI platform into a collaborative enterprise solution where teams can work together on AI/ML projects in real-time.
