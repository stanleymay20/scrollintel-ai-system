## Success Criteria

Upon completion, the system will:

1. **Definitively classify ScrollIntel** as either "Master of Many Trades" or "Jack of All Trades" based on objective evidence
2. **Provide quantitative proof** of mastery levels across all domains with performance percentiles
3. **Demonstrate integration advantages** through measurable synergy benefits and multiplicative value
4. **Show competitive superiority** through head-to-head comparisons with specialized tools
5. **Identify improvement areas** with specific recommendations for achieving mastery where gaps exist
6. **Generate compelling evidence** for ScrollIntel's unique positioning as "Integrated Specialized Intelligence"

The implementation will provide a comprehensive, evidence-based answer to the fundamental question of whether ScrollIntel's breadth enhances or dilutes its depth, settling the "jack of all trades" debate once and for all.
