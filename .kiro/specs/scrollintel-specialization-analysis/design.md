# Design Document - ScrollIntel Specialization vs. Generalization Analysis

## Overview

This design provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing ScrollIntel's positioning on the specialization-generalization spectrum. Rather than being a simple "jack of all trades," ScrollIntel represents a new category: **Integrated Specialized Intelligence** - achieving mastery across multiple domains through synergistic knowledge integration.

The analysis reveals that ScrollIntel's breadth actually enhances its depth through cross-domain knowledge transfer, emergent capabilities, and integrated problem-solving approaches that exceed what isolated specialized tools can achieve.
