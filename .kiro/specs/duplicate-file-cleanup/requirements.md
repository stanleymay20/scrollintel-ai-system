# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ScrollIntel codebase has accumulated numerous duplicate files that create maintenance overhead, potential inconsistencies, and confusion for developers. This feature will systematically identify, analyze, and consolidate duplicate files while preserving functionality and maintaining proper imports/references.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Duplicate File Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify all duplicate files in the codebase so that I can understand the scope of the cleanup needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all files with identical names across different directories
2. WHEN duplicate files are found THEN the system SHALL categorize them by type (configuration, implementation, test, etc.)
3. WHEN analyzing duplicates THEN the system SHALL determine which files have identical content vs similar functionality
4. IF files have identical content THEN the system SHALL flag them for immediate consolidation
5. IF files have similar but different content THEN the system SHALL flag them for manual review

### Requirement 2: Safe File Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to safely consolidate duplicate files so that I can reduce codebase complexity without breaking functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidating duplicate files THEN the system SHALL preserve the most comprehensive/recent version
2. WHEN removing duplicate files THEN the system SHALL update all import statements and references
3. WHEN consolidating files THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for existing functionality
4. IF consolidation would break functionality THEN the system SHALL create appropriate abstractions or interfaces
5. WHEN consolidation is complete THEN all tests SHALL continue to pass

### Requirement 3: Configuration File Unification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to unify duplicate configuration files so that I have a single source of truth for system configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple config.py files exist THEN the system SHALL create a hierarchical configuration system
2. WHEN consolidating configurations THEN the system SHALL preserve environment-specific settings
3. WHEN unifying configs THEN the system SHALL maintain the ability to override settings per module/service
4. IF configuration conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution strategies
5. WHEN configuration is unified THEN documentation SHALL be updated to reflect the new structure

### Requirement 4: Database Layer Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to consolidate duplicate database files so that I have consistent database access patterns across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple database.py files exist THEN the system SHALL create a unified database abstraction layer
2. WHEN consolidating database files THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing connection patterns
3. WHEN unifying database access THEN the system SHALL maintain support for multiple database backends
4. IF database implementations differ THEN the system SHALL create appropriate adapter patterns
5. WHEN database consolidation is complete THEN all database operations SHALL function identically

### Requirement 5: Route and API Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to consolidate duplicate API route files so that I have consistent API patterns and avoid endpoint conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate route files exist THEN the system SHALL merge compatible routes into unified modules
2. WHEN consolidating routes THEN the system SHALL detect and resolve endpoint conflicts
3. WHEN merging API files THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality
4. IF route implementations conflict THEN the system SHALL create versioned endpoints or namespaces
5. WHEN route consolidation is complete THEN API documentation SHALL be updated

### Requirement 6: Test File Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to organize duplicate test files so that I have clear test coverage without redundancy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate test files exist THEN the system SHALL merge compatible test cases
2. WHEN consolidating tests THEN the system SHALL preserve all unique test scenarios
3. WHEN organizing test files THEN the system SHALL maintain proper test isolation
4. IF test implementations overlap THEN the system SHALL remove redundant tests while preserving coverage
5. WHEN test consolidation is complete THEN test coverage SHALL be maintained or improved

### Requirement 7: Import and Reference Updates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all import statements and file references to be automatically updated so that the codebase continues to function after consolidation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are consolidated THEN the system SHALL scan all Python files for import statements
2. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL handle both absolute and relative import patterns
3. WHEN references are updated THEN the system SHALL update configuration files, documentation, and scripts
4. IF import updates would create circular dependencies THEN the system SHALL refactor to resolve them
5. WHEN all updates are complete THEN the system SHALL verify that all imports resolve correctly

### Requirement 8: Validation and Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive validation that the consolidation was successful so that I can be confident the system still works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidation is complete THEN the system SHALL run all existing tests to verify functionality
2. WHEN validating changes THEN the system SHALL check that all imports resolve successfully
3. WHEN testing consolidation THEN the system SHALL verify that all API endpoints still respond correctly
4. IF any tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed reports on what needs to be fixed
5. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL generate a summary report of all changes made
