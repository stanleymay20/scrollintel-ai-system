# Requirements Document - Advanced Prompt Management System

## Introduction

The Advanced Prompt Management System provides comprehensive prompt engineering capabilities including template libraries, version control, A/B testing, optimization, and collaborative prompt development. This system enables teams to systematically improve AI model performance through structured prompt engineering workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a prompt engineer, I want a centralized library of prompt templates, so that I can reuse and share effective prompts across projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating prompts THEN the system SHALL provide a template library with categorized prompts
2. WHEN saving prompts THEN the system SHALL support tagging, categorization, and search functionality
3. WHEN sharing prompts THEN the system SHALL enable team-wide access with permission controls
4. IF prompts are modified THEN the system SHALL maintain version history and change tracking

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AI engineer, I want to A/B test different prompt variations, so that I can optimize model performance systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up experiments THEN the system SHALL support multi-variant prompt testing
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL collect performance metrics and user feedback
3. WHEN analyzing results THEN the system SHALL provide statistical significance testing
4. IF winning variants are identified THEN the system SHALL enable automatic promotion to production

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want automated prompt optimization, so that I can improve model outputs without manual trial-and-error.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizing prompts THEN the system SHALL use genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning
2. WHEN evaluating performance THEN the system SHALL measure accuracy, relevance, and efficiency metrics
3. WHEN optimization completes THEN the system SHALL provide detailed improvement reports
4. IF optimization fails THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and recommendations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to track prompt performance across all projects, so that I can identify best practices and areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prompts are used THEN the system SHALL collect usage analytics and performance data
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide team-wide prompt performance insights
3. WHEN identifying trends THEN the system SHALL highlight top-performing prompt patterns
4. IF issues are detected THEN the system SHALL alert relevant team members automatically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want audit trails for all prompt changes, so that I can ensure regulatory compliance and quality control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prompts are modified THEN the system SHALL log all changes with user attribution
2. WHEN reviewing history THEN the system SHALL provide complete audit trails with timestamps
3. WHEN compliance checks are needed THEN the system SHALL generate compliance reports
4. IF unauthorized changes occur THEN the system SHALL alert administrators immediately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate prompt management into my applications, so that I can use optimized prompts programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing prompts THEN the system SHALL provide REST API and SDK integration
2. WHEN deploying applications THEN the system SHALL support prompt versioning and rollback
3. WHEN monitoring usage THEN the system SHALL track API usage and performance metrics
4. IF API limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL provide rate limiting and usage alerts
