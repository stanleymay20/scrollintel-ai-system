# Requirements Document - Hyperscale Infrastructure Mastery System

## Introduction

The Hyperscale Infrastructure Mastery System enables ScrollIntel to manage global infrastructure at scales that surpass Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, handling billions of users, exabytes of data, and millions of servers with superhuman efficiency and optimization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a hyperscale operator, I want infrastructure management that surpasses Amazon's scale, so that I can handle 10+ billion users with better performance and lower costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing global infrastructure THEN the system SHALL optimize across 10M+ servers and 100+ data centers
2. WHEN traffic spikes occur THEN the system SHALL auto-scale to handle 100M+ requests per second
3. WHEN performance optimization is needed THEN the system SHALL achieve 99.999% uptime across all services
4. IF cost optimization is required THEN the system SHALL reduce infrastructure costs by 50%+ while improving performance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a performance optimizer, I want real-time optimization that exceeds Google's capabilities, so that I can achieve microsecond response times at global scale.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN latency optimization is needed THEN the system SHALL achieve sub-millisecond response times globally
2. WHEN resource allocation occurs THEN the system SHALL optimize across quantum, classical, and edge computing
3. WHEN bottlenecks are detected THEN the system SHALL resolve them before they impact users
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL self-heal and optimize automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a reliability engineer, I want fault tolerance that surpasses all Big Tech companies, so that I can achieve zero downtime even during major failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system failures occur THEN the system SHALL maintain service availability through autonomous recovery
2. WHEN disasters strike THEN the system SHALL continue operations across multiple failure domains
3. WHEN attacks happen THEN the system SHALL defend and adapt faster than any human response
4. IF cascading failures begin THEN the system SHALL prevent them through predictive intervention
