# Launch Readiness Fixes

## Introduction

ScrollIntel has a comprehensive foundation but requires immediate fixes to be launch-ready. The application has extensive functionality but configuration and startup issues prevent successful deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Configuration Fix

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to start without configuration errors, so that I can deploy ScrollIntel successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load all configuration parameters correctly
2. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with solutions
3. WHEN using fallback configurations THEN the system SHALL log warnings but continue operation

### Requirement 2: Database Connectivity

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable database connectivity, so that the application can store and retrieve data properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PostgreSQL is available THEN the system SHALL connect to the primary database
2. WHEN PostgreSQL is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to SQLite gracefully
3. WHEN database initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 3: Service Orchestration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want all services to start correctly, so that the full application stack is available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting with Docker Compose THEN all services SHALL start successfully
2. WHEN services fail to start THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information
3. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL start with minimal dependencies

### Requirement 4: Frontend Integration

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to access the web interface, so that I can interact with ScrollIntel through a user-friendly UI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend starts THEN it SHALL be accessible on the configured port
2. WHEN the backend is available THEN the frontend SHALL connect successfully
3. WHEN services are unavailable THEN the frontend SHALL show appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5: Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive health checks, so that I can monitor system status and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN health checks run THEN they SHALL report accurate service status
2. WHEN services are unhealthy THEN the system SHALL provide specific error details
3. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL suggest actionable solutions
