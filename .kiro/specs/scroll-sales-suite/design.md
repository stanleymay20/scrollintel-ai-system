# ScrollSalesSuite Design Document

## Overview

ScrollSalesSuite is architected as a high-performance, enterprise-grade sales intelligence and revenue automation module that integrates seamlessly with ScrollIntel's core AI-CTO platform. The system employs a microservices architecture with three specialized AI agents (ScrollSDR, ScrollCaller, ScrollRevOps) that work in concert to deliver superior sales performance metrics compared to AltaHQ.

The design emphasizes real-time processing, multi-source data integration, advanced AI/ML capabilities, and enterprise-level security and compliance. The system is built to handle global operations with multi-language support while maintaining sub-30-second response times for critical operations.

## Error Handling

### Error Classification

1. **System Errors**: Infrastructure, database, or service failures
2. **Integration Errors**: External API failures or data inconsistencies
3. **Business Logic Errors**: Invalid data or business rule violations
4. **Compliance Errors**: Privacy or regulatory violations
5. **Performance Errors**: Timeout or resource exhaustion issues

### Error Handling Strategy

**Graceful Degradation**:
- Fallback to cached data when real-time sources are unavailable
- Reduced functionality modes for partial system failures
- Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

**Error Recovery**:
- Automatic healing for transient failures
- Circuit breaker patterns for external service protection
- Dead letter queues for failed message processing

**Monitoring and Alerting**:
- Real-time error tracking and alerting
- Performance degradation detection
- Automated escalation procedures

### Compliance Error Handling

**Immediate Response**:
- Automatic call termination for compliance violations
- Data processing halt for privacy violations
- Immediate notification to compliance officers

**Remediation**:
- Automated data deletion for retention violations
- Consent re-collection workflows
- Audit trail preservation for investigations
