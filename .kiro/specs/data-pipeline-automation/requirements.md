# Requirements Document - Data Pipeline Automation System

## Introduction

The Data Pipeline Automation System provides intelligent ETL/ELT workflow automation with visual pipeline building, automated data quality monitoring, and smart transformation recommendations. This system enables CTOs to automate complex data workflows without manual coding, ensuring reliable data flow across enterprise systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a CTO, I want visual pipeline building capabilities, so that I can design complex data workflows without writing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating pipelines THEN the system SHALL provide drag-and-drop visual interface
2. WHEN connecting data sources THEN the system SHALL auto-detect schemas and suggest transformations
3. WHEN configuring transformations THEN the system SHALL provide pre-built transformation templates
4. IF pipeline complexity increases THEN the system SHALL provide optimization recommendations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want automated data quality monitoring, so that I can ensure data integrity without manual validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data flows through pipelines THEN the system SHALL automatically validate data quality
2. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL alert relevant stakeholders immediately
3. WHEN data quality degrades THEN the system SHALL suggest remediation actions
4. IF critical issues occur THEN the system SHALL automatically pause affected pipelines

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want intelligent data transformation suggestions, so that I can prepare data for analysis efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing data schemas THEN the system SHALL recommend appropriate transformations
2. WHEN data types mismatch THEN the system SHALL suggest conversion strategies
3. WHEN joining datasets THEN the system SHALL identify optimal join keys and methods
4. IF performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL recommend optimization strategies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated pipeline orchestration, so that I can ensure reliable data processing at scale.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scheduling pipelines THEN the system SHALL support complex scheduling with dependencies
2. WHEN pipelines fail THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN resource constraints occur THEN the system SHALL dynamically allocate resources
4. IF bottlenecks are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically scale processing capacity

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive data lineage tracking, so that I can ensure regulatory compliance and audit trails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is processed THEN the system SHALL track complete data lineage and transformations
2. WHEN audits are conducted THEN the system SHALL provide detailed processing history
3. WHEN sensitive data is handled THEN the system SHALL enforce data governance policies
4. IF compliance violations occur THEN the system SHALL immediately alert and remediate

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want pipeline performance monitoring, so that I can optimize data processing efficiency and costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pipelines execute THEN the system SHALL monitor performance metrics and resource usage
2. WHEN costs exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and suggest optimizations
3. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL identify bottlenecks and recommend solutions
4. IF SLA violations occur THEN the system SHALL trigger automatic escalation procedures
