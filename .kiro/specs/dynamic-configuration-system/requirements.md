# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive Dynamic Configuration Management System that eliminates hardcoded values throughout the ScrollIntel platform. The system will provide runtime configuration management, environment-specific settings, dynamic parameter adjustment, and flexible system behavior without requiring code changes or deployments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage all system configurations through a centralized interface, so that I can adjust system behavior without modifying code or redeploying services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the configuration interface THEN the system SHALL display all configurable parameters organized by category and service
2. WHEN an administrator modifies a configuration value THEN the system SHALL validate the input against defined constraints and data types
3. WHEN a valid configuration change is submitted THEN the system SHALL apply the change immediately without requiring service restart
4. WHEN an invalid configuration is submitted THEN the system SHALL reject the change and provide clear error messaging
5. IF a configuration change affects dependent services THEN the system SHALL automatically notify and update those services

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define configuration schemas and defaults programmatically, so that new features can be made configurable without hardcoding values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer defines a configuration schema THEN the system SHALL automatically generate validation rules and UI components
2. WHEN a configuration parameter is accessed in code THEN the system SHALL return the current runtime value with proper type casting
3. WHEN no custom value is set THEN the system SHALL return the defined default value
4. WHEN a configuration schema includes constraints THEN the system SHALL enforce those constraints at runtime
5. IF a configuration parameter is marked as sensitive THEN the system SHALL encrypt the value and mask it in interfaces

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to manage different configurations for different environments, so that I can maintain consistent deployment processes across development, staging, and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to an environment THEN the system SHALL automatically load environment-specific configuration overrides
2. WHEN environment configurations conflict THEN the system SHALL apply precedence rules (environment > user > default)
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL maintain an audit trail with timestamps and user information
4. WHEN rolling back configurations THEN the system SHALL support point-in-time restoration of previous configuration states
5. IF configuration synchronization is enabled THEN the system SHALL replicate approved changes across specified environments

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an AI model operator, I want to adjust model parameters and thresholds dynamically, so that I can optimize performance without retraining or redeploying models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model parameters are modified THEN the system SHALL apply changes to running model instances immediately
2. WHEN parameter changes affect model behavior THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics before and after changes
3. WHEN critical thresholds are adjusted THEN the system SHALL validate that changes don't violate safety constraints
4. WHEN A/B testing is enabled THEN the system SHALL support gradual rollout of parameter changes to subsets of traffic
5. IF parameter changes cause performance degradation THEN the system SHALL support automatic rollback based on defined criteria

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to customize system behavior through configuration templates, so that I can adapt the system to different business processes without technical intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a business user selects a configuration template THEN the system SHALL apply predefined parameter sets appropriate for their use case
2. WHEN templates are applied THEN the system SHALL allow override of specific parameters while maintaining template structure
3. WHEN creating custom templates THEN the system SHALL provide a guided interface for parameter selection and validation
4. WHEN templates are shared THEN the system SHALL support template versioning and collaborative editing
5. IF template conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution options and impact analysis

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want to configure external service connections and API parameters, so that I can adapt the system to different infrastructure environments without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring external services THEN the system SHALL support connection testing and validation
2. WHEN API endpoints change THEN the system SHALL allow runtime updates of service URLs and authentication parameters
3. WHEN service configurations are modified THEN the system SHALL update connection pools and client configurations automatically
4. WHEN external services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL apply configured fallback and retry policies
5. IF service configurations include credentials THEN the system SHALL integrate with secure credential management systems

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to ensure configuration changes follow approval workflows, so that system modifications meet regulatory and security requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sensitive configurations are modified THEN the system SHALL require approval from designated reviewers
2. WHEN configuration changes are proposed THEN the system SHALL route them through defined approval workflows
3. WHEN changes are approved THEN the system SHALL automatically apply them according to scheduled deployment windows
4. WHEN changes are rejected THEN the system SHALL notify requesters with detailed rejection reasons
5. IF emergency changes are required THEN the system SHALL support expedited approval processes with enhanced logging

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want to monitor the impact of configuration changes on system performance, so that I can optimize settings based on real-world usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration changes are applied THEN the system SHALL automatically collect performance metrics before and after changes
2. WHEN performance impacts are detected THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and recommendations for optimization
3. WHEN analyzing configuration effectiveness THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards showing correlation between settings and performance
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL suggest configuration rollbacks or alternative parameter values
5. IF machine learning optimization is enabled THEN the system SHALL recommend configuration improvements based on usage patterns
