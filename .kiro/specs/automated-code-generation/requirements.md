# Requirements Document - Automated Code Generation System

## Introduction

The Automated Code Generation System enables CTOs to generate working applications from natural language requirements and data schemas. This system transforms ScrollIntel from a data analysis platform into a complete application development platform, allowing non-technical users to create full-stack applications through AI-powered code generation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to generate working applications from natural language descriptions, so that I can create software solutions without programming knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing requirements in natural language THEN the system SHALL generate complete application specifications
2. WHEN specifications are approved THEN the system SHALL generate full-stack application code
3. WHEN code is generated THEN the system SHALL include frontend, backend, and database components
4. IF requirements are unclear THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions to ensure accuracy

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data architect, I want automatic API generation from data schemas, so that I can quickly create data access layers for applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data schemas are provided THEN the system SHALL generate RESTful API endpoints automatically
2. WHEN APIs are generated THEN the system SHALL include CRUD operations, validation, and documentation
3. WHEN schema changes occur THEN the system SHALL update APIs automatically while maintaining backward compatibility
4. IF complex relationships exist THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate join and aggregation endpoints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want automated database design from business requirements, so that I can create optimized database schemas efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business requirements are analyzed THEN the system SHALL generate normalized database schemas
2. WHEN schemas are created THEN the system SHALL include indexes, constraints, and relationships
3. WHEN performance requirements exist THEN the system SHALL optimize schema design for query performance
4. IF data migration is needed THEN the system SHALL generate migration scripts and procedures

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want automated UI component generation, so that I can create user interfaces quickly from mockups or descriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI requirements are provided THEN the system SHALL generate responsive React components
2. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL include proper styling, accessibility, and interactions
3. WHEN data integration is needed THEN the system SHALL generate API integration code automatically
4. IF design systems exist THEN the system SHALL follow established component patterns and styles

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want automated test generation, so that I can ensure code quality without manual test writing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is generated THEN the system SHALL create comprehensive unit tests automatically
2. WHEN APIs are created THEN the system SHALL generate integration tests for all endpoints
3. WHEN UI components are built THEN the system SHALL create end-to-end tests for user workflows
4. IF bugs are detected THEN the system SHALL generate additional test cases to prevent regression

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated deployment configuration, so that I can deploy generated applications without manual infrastructure setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applications are generated THEN the system SHALL create Docker containers and deployment scripts
2. WHEN cloud deployment is needed THEN the system SHALL generate infrastructure-as-code templates
3. WHEN CI/CD is required THEN the system SHALL create automated pipeline configurations
4. IF scaling is anticipated THEN the system SHALL include auto-scaling and load balancing configurations
