# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines ScrollIntel X (SI-X): "Agentic, Audited, Scroll-Governed Intelligence API for the Next Era" - a comprehensive upgrade that integrates proven patterns from Bavest's data infrastructure and Enigma's multimodal agentic systems. The system will provide a unified API layer, multimodal retrieval capabilities, LangGraph-style workflow management, and comprehensive evaluation pipelines while maintaining scroll-aligned governance.

## Requirements

2. WHEN accuracy is evaluated THEN hallucination reduction percentages SHALL be calculated
3. WHEN authorship is validated THEN drift-proof confidence scores SHALL be provided
4. IF benchmarks are requested THEN real-time performance dashboards SHALL be available
5. WHEN reports are generated THEN they SHALL include cost savings and efficiency metrics

### Requirement 4: Multimodal Retrieval Pipeline (Enigma Pattern)

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to ingest and process multiple content types including PDFs, audio, video, and structured data, so that ScrollIntel can access comprehensive spiritual libraries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PDF documents are uploaded THEN they SHALL be processed for text extraction and semantic indexing
2. WHEN audio/video content is provided THEN transcription and content analysis SHALL be performed
3. WHEN structured data is ingested THEN JSON, XML, and database formats SHALL be supported
4. IF biblical manuscripts are processed THEN specialized handling for ancient texts SHALL be applied
5. WHEN content is indexed THEN multimodal search across all formats SHALL be enabled

### Requirement 5: LangGraph-Style Workflow Management (Enigma Pattern)

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want sophisticated workflow orchestration using DAG-style agent coordination, so that complex multi-step reasoning can be managed reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows are defined THEN they SHALL use directed acyclic graph (DAG) structures
2. WHEN agents are orchestrated THEN the ScrollConductor SHALL manage step-by-step execution
3. WHEN workflow steps execute THEN dependencies and prerequisites SHALL be enforced
4. IF workflow failures occur THEN recovery and retry mechanisms SHALL be triggered
5. WHEN workflows complete THEN results SHALL be aggregated and validated

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Agent Evaluation (Enigma Pattern)

**User Story:** As a quality assurance manager, I want detailed evaluation metrics for every agent interaction, so that I can ensure consistent high-quality outputs and scroll alignment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents process requests THEN accuracy, relevance, and confidence scores SHALL be calculated
2. WHEN evaluations are performed THEN scroll alignment metrics SHALL be included
3. WHEN drift is detected THEN automatic flagging and correction SHALL occur
4. IF evaluation thresholds are not met THEN escalation to human oversight SHALL be triggered
5. WHEN reports are generated THEN comprehensive evaluation dashboards SHALL be available

### Requirement 7: Production Stability and Reliability (Enigma Pattern)

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want enterprise-grade stability with retry logic, comprehensive logging, and graceful degradation, so that ScrollIntel operates reliably in mission-critical environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system failures occur THEN automatic retry mechanisms SHALL be activated
2. WHEN errors are encountered THEN comprehensive logging and tracing SHALL be captured
3. WHEN agents are unavailable THEN graceful fallback to alternative agents SHALL occur
4. IF critical failures happen THEN escalation to human prophets/seers SHALL be available
5. WHEN system recovery occurs THEN automatic healing and restoration SHALL be performed

### Requirement 8: Scroll-Governed Intelligence Framework

**User Story:** As a spiritual leader, I want AI systems that maintain alignment with scroll principles and can escalate to human spiritual oversight when needed, so that technology serves divine purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI decisions are made THEN scroll alignment validation SHALL be performed
2. WHEN spiritual discernment is needed THEN human prophet/seer escalation SHALL be available
3. WHEN outputs are generated THEN they SHALL be checked against scroll principles
4. IF alignment concerns arise THEN automatic flagging and review SHALL occur
5. WHEN spiritual oversight is provided THEN it SHALL override AI recommendations when necessary

### Requirement 9: Advanced API Security and Governance

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive API security with authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and audit trails, so that ScrollIntel access is properly controlled and monitored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API access is requested THEN multi-factor authentication SHALL be required
2. WHEN operations are performed THEN role-based authorization SHALL be enforced
3. WHEN high-volume usage occurs THEN intelligent rate limiting SHALL be applied
4. IF security violations are detected THEN immediate blocking and alerting SHALL occur
5. WHEN activities are logged THEN comprehensive audit trails SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 10: Real-Time Collaboration and Feedback

**User Story:** As a ministry team member, I want real-time collaboration features with feedback collection and continuous improvement, so that ScrollIntel evolves based on community input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with the system THEN real-time feedback collection SHALL be enabled
2. WHEN feedback is provided THEN it SHALL be immediately processed and analyzed
3. WHEN improvements are identified THEN they SHALL be automatically implemented where possible
4. IF community consensus emerges THEN system behavior SHALL adapt accordingly
5. WHEN collaboration occurs THEN shared workspaces and team features SHALL be available

### Requirement 11: Intelligent Caching and Optimization

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want intelligent caching strategies that optimize for both speed and spiritual accuracy, so that ScrollIntel delivers fast, reliable responses.
