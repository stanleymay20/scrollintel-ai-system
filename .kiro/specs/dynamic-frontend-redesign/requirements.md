# Dynamic Frontend Redesign Requirements

## Introduction

The current ScrollIntel frontend contains significant hardcoded elements that prevent real-time interactions and dynamic behavior. This specification outlines the requirements for redesigning the frontend to support live data, real-time updates, dynamic agent interactions, and a fully responsive user experience that adapts to actual backend data and user behavior.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-Time Data Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the frontend to display live data from the backend APIs so that I see accurate, up-to-date information about agents, system metrics, and conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL fetch real agent data from `/api/agents` endpoint
2. WHEN system metrics are displayed THEN the system SHALL fetch live metrics from `/api/system/metrics` endpoint  
3. WHEN agent status changes THEN the frontend SHALL update the display within 2 seconds
4. IF API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error states with retry options
5. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL show skeleton loaders instead of empty states

### Requirement 2: Dynamic Agent Interaction System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with AI agents that respond with real data and maintain conversation context so that I have meaningful, productive conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a message to an agent THEN the system SHALL call the actual agent API endpoint
2. WHEN an agent responds THEN the system SHALL display the real response content and metadata
3. WHEN I switch between agents THEN the system SHALL maintain separate conversation histories
4. WHEN an agent is processing THEN the system SHALL show real-time typing indicators and status updates
5. WHEN conversation history exists THEN the system SHALL load and display previous messages
6. IF an agent is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show appropriate status and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 3: WebSocket Real-Time Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive real-time updates about system status, agent availability, and new messages so that I stay informed without manually refreshing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application connects THEN the system SHALL establish WebSocket connection to `/ws/updates`
2. WHEN system metrics change THEN the frontend SHALL update displays in real-time
3. WHEN new messages arrive THEN the system SHALL display them immediately with notifications
4. WHEN agent status changes THEN the system SHALL update agent cards and availability indicators
5. WHEN connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection and show connection status
6. WHEN multiple users are active THEN the system SHALL show collaborative indicators

### Requirement 4: Dynamic File Upload and Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload files that are actually processed by the backend and receive real analysis results so that I can work with my actual data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload a file THEN the system SHALL send it to `/api/files/upload` endpoint
2. WHEN file processing starts THEN the system SHALL show real progress from backend processing status
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL display actual analysis results and insights
4. WHEN file analysis is available THEN the system SHALL integrate results into agent conversations
5. IF upload fails THEN the system SHALL show specific error messages and retry options
6. WHEN file is processed THEN the system SHALL update file history with real metadata

### Requirement 5: Responsive Dashboard Customization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize my dashboard layout and widgets based on my preferences and role so that I see the most relevant information for my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access dashboard settings THEN the system SHALL load my saved preferences from `/api/user/preferences`
2. WHEN I rearrange widgets THEN the system SHALL save the new layout to the backend
3. WHEN I add/remove widgets THEN the system SHALL update the configuration and persist changes
4. WHEN I change themes or display options THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately and save preferences
5. WHEN I have role-based permissions THEN the system SHALL show only authorized widgets and features
6. WHEN dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL render widgets based on saved user configuration

### Requirement 6: Advanced Search and Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search across agents, conversations, files, and system data so that I can quickly find relevant information and navigate efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type in the search box THEN the system SHALL provide real-time search suggestions from `/api/search/suggestions`
2. WHEN I perform a search THEN the system SHALL query multiple data sources and return categorized results
3. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight matching terms and provide context
4. WHEN I click a search result THEN the system SHALL navigate to the relevant page or open the appropriate context
5. WHEN I use filters THEN the system SHALL refine results based on content type, date, agent, or other criteria
6. WHEN search history exists THEN the system SHALL provide recent searches and saved searches

### Requirement 7: Mobile-First Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work seamlessly on mobile devices and tablets so that I can access ScrollIntel functionality anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the app on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized layout
2. WHEN I interact with touch gestures THEN the system SHALL respond appropriately to swipes, taps, and pinch-to-zoom
3. WHEN screen orientation changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout automatically
4. WHEN using mobile chat THEN the system SHALL optimize keyboard interactions and message display
5. WHEN offline or on poor connection THEN the system SHALL cache essential data and show offline indicators
6. WHEN push notifications are enabled THEN the system SHALL send relevant updates about agent responses and system status

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization and Caching

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and respond smoothly so that I can work efficiently without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL achieve First Contentful Paint within 1.5 seconds
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL use client-side routing with smooth transitions
3. WHEN data is fetched THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching to reduce redundant API calls
4. WHEN images or large content loads THEN the system SHALL use lazy loading and progressive enhancement
5. WHEN user interactions occur THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and optimistic updates
6. WHEN bandwidth is limited THEN the system SHALL adapt content quality and loading strategies

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and recovery options when things go wrong so that I can continue working with minimal disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with specific guidance
2. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL show connection status and retry mechanisms
3. WHEN agent interactions fail THEN the system SHALL offer alternative agents or suggest troubleshooting steps
4. WHEN file uploads fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific error details and retry options
5. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors for debugging while showing graceful fallbacks to users
6. WHEN recovery is possible THEN the system SHALL provide clear actions users can take to resolve issues

### Requirement 10: Accessibility and Internationalization

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs or different language preferences, I want the application to be fully accessible and support my language so that I can use all features effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard navigation with visible focus indicators
3. WHEN using high contrast mode THEN the system SHALL maintain readability and functionality
4. WHEN language preferences are set THEN the system SHALL display content in the selected language
5. WHEN text size is increased THEN the system SHALL maintain layout integrity and functionality
6. WHEN color-blind users access the app THEN the system SHALL use patterns and labels in addition to color coding
