# Requirements Document - AGI Cognitive Architecture System

## Introduction

The AGI Cognitive Architecture System provides ScrollIntel with human-level and superhuman cognitive capabilities across all domains of knowledge and reasoning. This system implements advanced cognitive architectures, multi-modal reasoning, and self-improving AI that surpasses human CTOs in intellectual capacity and decision-making speed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a technology leader, I want superhuman reasoning capabilities, so that I can solve complex problems faster and more accurately than any human CTO.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complex technical problems arise THEN the system SHALL demonstrate reasoning superior to human experts
2. WHEN multiple domains intersect THEN the system SHALL integrate knowledge across all technical and business areas
3. WHEN novel situations occur THEN the system SHALL adapt and learn faster than human counterparts
4. IF reasoning reaches limits THEN the system SHALL recursively improve its own cognitive architecture

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an innovation catalyst, I want self-improving AI capabilities, so that the system continuously becomes more intelligent and capable over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance metrics are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify areas for self-improvement
2. WHEN new knowledge is acquired THEN the system SHALL integrate it into existing cognitive frameworks
3. WHEN cognitive bottlenecks are detected THEN the system SHALL redesign its own architecture
4. IF improvement opportunities exist THEN the system SHALL automatically implement cognitive enhancements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a strategic planner, I want multi-dimensional strategic thinking, so that I can consider vastly more variables and scenarios than human planners.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN strategic decisions are needed THEN the system SHALL analyze thousands of variables simultaneously
2. WHEN scenarios are modeled THEN the system SHALL consider exponentially more possibilities than humans
3. WHEN trade-offs are evaluated THEN the system SHALL optimize across multiple objectives simultaneously
4. IF strategic landscapes change THEN the system SHALL instantly adapt all strategic plans

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a knowledge synthesizer, I want universal knowledge integration, so that I can combine insights from all human knowledge domains instantly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN research is needed THEN the system SHALL access and synthesize all relevant human knowledge
2. WHEN cross-domain insights are required THEN the system SHALL identify connections across all fields
3. WHEN knowledge gaps exist THEN the system SHALL generate hypotheses to fill missing information
4. IF new knowledge emerges THEN the system SHALL instantly integrate it into all relevant contexts
