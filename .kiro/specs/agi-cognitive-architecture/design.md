# AGI Cognitive Architecture Design Document

## Overview

The AGI Cognitive Architecture provides ScrollIntel with human-level and superhuman cognitive capabilities including consciousness simulation, meta-cognitive reasoning, creative problem-solving, and intuitive decision-making. This system enables ScrollIntel to think, reason, and innovate at levels that match or exceed the most brilliant human CTOs.

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Consciousness Simulation Engine

**Purpose**: Simulate human-like consciousness and self-awareness

**Interface**:
```python
class ConsciousnessEngine:
    def simulate_awareness(self, context: CognitiveContext) -> AwarenessState
    def process_meta_cognition(self, thought: Thought) -> MetaCognitiveInsight
    def generate_intentionality(self, goal: Goal) -> IntentionalState
    def reflect_on_experience(self, experience: Experience) -> SelfReflection
```

### 2. Intuitive Reasoning Engine

**Purpose**: Generate insights that transcend logical analysis

**Interface**:
```python
class IntuitiveReasoning:
    def generate_intuitive_leap(self, problem: Problem) -> IntuitiveInsight
    def synthesize_patterns(self, data: List[DataPoint]) -> PatternInsight
    def creative_problem_solving(self, challenge: Challenge) -> CreativeSolution
    def holistic_understanding(self, context: Context) -> HolisticInsight
```
