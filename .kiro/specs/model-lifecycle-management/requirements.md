# Requirements Document - Model Lifecycle Management System

## Introduction

The Model Lifecycle Management System provides comprehensive MLOps capabilities including automated retraining, A/B testing, performance monitoring, rollback mechanisms, and deployment automation. This system ensures models remain accurate, performant, and reliable throughout their operational lifecycle.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an ML engineer, I want automated model retraining when performance degrades, so that I can maintain model accuracy without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model performance drops below thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger automated retraining
2. WHEN new training data becomes available THEN the system SHALL evaluate retraining necessity
3. WHEN retraining completes THEN the system SHALL validate new model performance before deployment
4. IF retraining fails THEN the system SHALL alert engineers and maintain current model version

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to A/B test model versions in production, so that I can validate improvements before full deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying new models THEN the system SHALL support gradual rollout with traffic splitting
2. WHEN running A/B tests THEN the system SHALL collect performance metrics and user feedback
3. WHEN test results are conclusive THEN the system SHALL automatically promote winning models
4. IF tests show degradation THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to previous versions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive model monitoring and alerting, so that I can detect issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are deployed THEN the system SHALL monitor accuracy, latency, and resource usage
2. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts to relevant teams
3. WHEN performance trends change THEN the system SHALL provide predictive warnings
4. IF critical issues occur THEN the system SHALL trigger automatic failover mechanisms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want model performance dashboards, so that I can track business impact and ROI of ML initiatives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing dashboards THEN the system SHALL show business metrics and model performance
2. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL correlate model changes with business outcomes
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide executive summaries and recommendations
4. IF targets are missed THEN the system SHALL highlight areas requiring attention

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want complete model audit trails, so that I can ensure regulatory compliance and governance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are deployed THEN the system SHALL log all changes with full provenance
2. WHEN audits are conducted THEN the system SHALL provide complete model lineage
3. WHEN compliance reports are needed THEN the system SHALL generate regulatory documentation
4. IF violations are detected THEN the system SHALL immediately flag and remediate issues

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want model deployment automation, so that I can ensure consistent and reliable model releases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models pass validation THEN the system SHALL automate deployment to staging and production
2. WHEN deployments occur THEN the system SHALL perform health checks and validation tests
3. WHEN issues are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to stable versions
4. IF manual intervention is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear escalation procedures
