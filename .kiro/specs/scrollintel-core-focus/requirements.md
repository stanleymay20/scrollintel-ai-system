# ScrollIntel Core Focus - Simplification Requirements

## Introduction

ScrollIntel has grown to encompass 48 different specifications covering everything from "infinite omnipotence" to "quantum AI research." This complexity is preventing the platform from achieving its core mission: being the best AI-CTO replacement platform.

This specification defines a focused approach that identifies the 5-7 core capabilities that make ScrollIntel valuable, eliminates feature creep, and creates a clear path to market leadership.

**Core Mission**: Build the world's best AI-CTO replacement platform that helps businesses make data-driven decisions without hiring technical staff.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core AI Agent Suite

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want 5-7 essential AI agents that replace key technical roles, so that I can run my business without hiring a full technical team.

2. WHEN I have data to analyze THEN the Data Scientist Agent SHALL automatically analyze, visualize, and provide insights
3. WHEN I need machine learning models THEN the ML Engineer Agent SHALL build, train, and deploy models automatically
4. WHEN I want business intelligence THEN the BI Agent SHALL create dashboards and reports from my data
5. WHEN I need AI/ML guidance THEN the AI Engineer Agent SHALL help with AI strategy and implementation
6. IF I have questions about my data THEN the QA Agent SHALL answer questions in natural language
7. IF I need forecasting THEN the Forecast Agent SHALL predict trends and future outcomes

### Requirement 2: Simple Data Upload & Analysis

**User Story:** As a non-technical user, I want to upload data files and get instant insights, so that I can make decisions quickly without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN data is processed THEN the system SHALL generate summary statistics, visualizations, and key insights
3. WHEN I ask questions about my data THEN the system SHALL provide answers in plain English
4. IF patterns exist in my data THEN the system SHALL highlight trends, anomalies, and opportunities

### Requirement 3: One-Click Model Building

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to build predictive models without technical expertise, so that I can forecast outcomes and optimize decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify a prediction target THEN the system SHALL automatically select appropriate algorithms
2. WHEN models are trained THEN the system SHALL test multiple approaches and recommend the best one
3. WHEN models are ready THEN the system SHALL provide simple explanations of how they work
4. IF I need predictions THEN the system SHALL make them available via simple API or web interface

### Requirement 4: Interactive Dashboards

**User Story:** As a decision maker, I want live dashboards that update automatically, so that I can monitor my business in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I connect data sources THEN the system SHALL create relevant dashboards automatically
2. WHEN data changes THEN dashboards SHALL update in real-time
3. WHEN I need specific views THEN the system SHALL allow customization through natural language
4. IF important changes occur THEN the system SHALL send alerts and notifications

### Requirement 5: Natural Language Interface

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to interact with all features through conversation, so that I don't need to learn complex interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask questions THEN the system SHALL understand context and provide relevant answers
2. WHEN I request actions THEN the system SHALL execute them and confirm completion
3. WHEN I need help THEN the system SHALL guide me through processes conversationally
4. IF I make mistakes THEN the system SHALL suggest corrections and alternatives

### Requirement 6: Enterprise Security & Compliance

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want my data to be secure and compliant, so that I can trust the platform with sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload data THEN the system SHALL encrypt it at rest and in transit
2. WHEN team members access the system THEN role-based permissions SHALL be enforced
3. WHEN audits are needed THEN the system SHALL provide complete activity logs
4. IF compliance is required THEN the system SHALL support GDPR, SOC2, and industry standards

### Requirement 7: Simple Deployment & Scaling

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want easy deployment options, so that I can get ScrollIntel running quickly in our environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to cloud THEN the system SHALL support one-click deployment to AWS, Azure, or GCP
2. WHEN traffic increases THEN the system SHALL auto-scale to handle demand
3. WHEN updates are available THEN the system SHALL update automatically with zero downtime
4. IF issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear diagnostics and recovery options

## Features to ELIMINATE

### High-Complexity, Low-Value Features:
- Quantum AI Research
- Infinite Omnipotence capabilities  
- Revolutionary Banking Transformation
- Global Influence Networks
- Superhuman Strategic Planning
- Universal Tech Role Supremacy
- AGI Cognitive Architecture
- Crisis Leadership Excellence
- Cultural Transformation Leadership
- Board Executive Mastery

### Reasoning:
These features add complexity without providing clear business value to the core AI-CTO use case. They distract from building excellent core functionality.

## Success Metrics

1. **User Onboarding**: New users can get value within 15 minutes
2. **Feature Usage**: 80% of users actively use all 7 core agents
3. **Customer Satisfaction**: 90%+ satisfaction with core functionality
4. **Technical Debt**: Codebase complexity reduced by 60%
5. **Market Position**: Clear differentiation as "AI-CTO replacement platform"
