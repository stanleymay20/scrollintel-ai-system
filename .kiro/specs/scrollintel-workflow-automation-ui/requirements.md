# Requirements Document - ScrollIntel Enhanced Workflow Automation UI/UX

## Introduction

ScrollIntel already possesses sophisticated workflow automation capabilities through its TaskOrchestrator and multi-agent system. However, these powerful features need an intuitive, user-friendly interface that allows both technical and non-technical users to easily create, manage, monitor, and optimize complex multi-agent workflows. This enhancement will transform ScrollIntel's existing workflow automation from a developer-focused system into a comprehensive no-code/low-code workflow platform that rivals industry leaders like Zapier, Microsoft Power Automate, and Temporal.

The enhanced workflow automation UI/UX will provide visual workflow designers, real-time monitoring dashboards, intelligent workflow recommendations, and seamless integration with ScrollIntel's existing 20+ AI agents and workflow templates.
