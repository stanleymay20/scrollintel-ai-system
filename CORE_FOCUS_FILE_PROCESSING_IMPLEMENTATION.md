### ✅ Requirement 3: Create data preprocessing pipeline with cleaning and normalization

**Implementation:**
- Comprehensive `preprocess_data()` method with configurable options
- Multi-step preprocessing pipeline with progress tracking
- Data type optimization for memory efficiency
- Advanced missing value handling strategies

**Preprocessing Features:**
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove empty rows/columns, handle duplicates
- **Data Type Optimization**: Automatic conversion to appropriate types
- **Missing Value Handling**: Multiple strategies (median, mean, mode, forward fill)
- **Text Normalization**: Whitespace trimming, standardization of null values
- **Outlier Handling**: IQR and Z-score based outlier detection and capping
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient data type selection

### ✅ Requirement 4: Add file size limits and security validation

**Implementation:**
- Comprehensive security validation with multiple layers of protection
- File size limits (100MB) with clear error messages
- Enhanced filename validation and path traversal protection
- Content-based security scanning

**Security Features:**
- **File Size Validation**: 100MB limit (perfect for Core Focus)
- **Filename Security**: Length limits, dangerous character detection
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Prevention of directory traversal attacks
- **File Signature Validation**: Magic byte verification for binary formats
- **Content Security Scanning**: Detection of malicious patterns
- **Extension Validation**: Whitelist of allowed file extensions (.csv, .xlsx, .xls, .json)
- **Encoding Validation**: UTF-8 validation for text files

### ✅ Requirement 5: Build progress tracking for file processing operations

**Implementation:**
- Custom `ProgressTracker` class for operation monitoring
- Detailed progress updates throughout the processing pipeline
- Database status updates with progress percentage and messages
- Elapsed time tracking and performance monitoring

**Progress Tracking Features:**
- **Real-time Updates**: Progress percentage and descriptive messages
- **Database Integration**: Status updates stored in FileUpload records
- **Error Handling**: Failed operations tracked with error details
- **Performance Metrics**: Elapsed time and processing speed monitoring
- **Step-by-Step Tracking**: Granular progress for each processing phase

## Core Focus Integration

### Perfect Fit for 7 Core Agents

The File Processing System is specifically designed to support the 7 core AI agents:

1. **CTO Agent**: Processes technology stack data and architecture files
2. **Data Scientist Agent**: Handles exploratory data analysis on uploaded datasets
3. **ML Engineer Agent**: Processes training data for model building
4. **BI Agent**: Ingests business data for dashboard creation
5. **AI Engineer Agent**: Processes AI strategy and implementation data
6. **QA Agent**: Enables natural language querying of uploaded data
7. **Forecast Agent**: Handles time series data for prediction models

### API Integration

**Core Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/files/upload` - Upload and process files
- `GET /api/v1/files/upload/{id}/status` - Track processing progress
- `GET /api/v1/files/upload/{id}/preview` - Get data preview
- `GET /api/v1/files/upload/{id}/quality` - Get quality analysis
- `POST /api/v1/files/upload/{id}/create-dataset` - Create dataset for agents

### Performance Characteristics

**Processing Speed:**
- Small files (<1MB): Immediate processing with real-time updates
- Medium files (1-10MB): Background processing with progress tracking
- Large files (10-100MB): Chunked processing with memory management

**Quality Metrics:**
- Clean data: 90-100% quality scores
- Typical business data: 70-90% quality scores with recommendations
