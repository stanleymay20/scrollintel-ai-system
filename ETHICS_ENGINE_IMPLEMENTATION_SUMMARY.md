## üéØ Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Comprehensive Bias Detection
```python
# Detects bias across multiple protected attributes
result = await ethics_engine.detect_bias(
    data=dataset,
    predictions=model_predictions,
    protected_attributes=['gender', 'race', 'age_group'],
    true_labels=ground_truth,
    prediction_probabilities=pred_probs
)
```

### 2. Multi-Framework Compliance
```python
# Supports GDPR, NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, and more
compliance = await ethics_engine.check_regulatory_compliance(
    framework=ComplianceFramework.GDPR,
    model_info=model_metadata,
    bias_results=bias_analysis
)
```

### 3. Transparency Reporting
```python
# Generates comprehensive AI transparency documentation
report = await ethics_engine.generate_transparency_report(
    model_info=model_details,
    bias_results=bias_analysis,
    performance_metrics=model_performance
)
```
